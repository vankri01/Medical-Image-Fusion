# Medical-Image-Fusion
This project aims to enhance diagnostic capabilities by effectively combining MRI and CT 
images of the brain. By fusing these complementary imaging modalities, we can provide a 
comprehensive view that captures both soft and hard tissue details, aiding in improved medical 
diagnosis. Our study focuses on two distinct image fusion algorithmsâ€”Principal Component 
Analysis (PCA) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based fusionâ€”to evaluate their 
efficacy in producing high-quality fused images. 

## Features

- Implementation of PCA-based and CNN-based image fusion.

- Utilizes Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for image decomposition.

- Performance evaluation using PSNR and MSE.

- Pre-processing techniques including noise reduction and contrast enhancement.

- Comparison of fusion outputs with qualitative and quantitative metrics.

## Dataset

- Source: Harvard Medical School Brain MRI-CT dataset.

## Formats: TIFF images.

## Number of Pairs: 8 MRI-CT image pairs.

## Technologies Used

- Programming Language: Python

- Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, Scikit-Image, PyTorch (for CNN model)

## Methodology

1. Data Collection: MRI & CT image acquisition.

2. Preprocessing:

3. Noise reduction (Non-Local Means Filter)

4. Contrast enhancement (CLAHE)

5. Edge sharpening (Unsharp Masking)

6.Fusion Techniques:

- PCA-based Fusion: Extracts principal components from both images and merges them.

- CNN-based Fusion (VGG19): Deep learning model trained on multimodal images.
- DWT-based Fusion: Decomposes images into frequency components and merges them.
7. Evaluation Metrics:

- ðŸ“Š PSNR: Measures the quality of the fused image.

- ðŸ“Š MSE: Determines error between fused and original images.
DWT-based Fusion: Decomposes images into frequency components and merges them.
