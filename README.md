# Medical-Image-Fusion
This project aims to enhance diagnostic capabilities by effectively combining MRI and CT 
images of the brain. By fusing these complementary imaging modalities, we can provide a 
comprehensive view that captures both soft and hard tissue details, aiding in improved medical 
diagnosis. Our study focuses on two distinct image fusion algorithms—Principal Component 
Analysis (PCA) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based fusion—to evaluate their 
efficacy in producing high-quality fused images.
